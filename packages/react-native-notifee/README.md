### Android

The APIs for Android allow for creating rich, styled and highly interactive notifications. Notifications are an important
concept on Android, and frequently receive new updates with each new API version.

Notifee has been designed to integrate with the latest API features, however also providing backwards compatibility for
older Android devices (Android 4.1 (API 16)).
