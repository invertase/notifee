Notifee is a licensed product and requires a valid license key to work when your application has been built
in release mode.

> Non-Profit organisations, free Open Source Applications & React Native Firebase core contributors can [request a free license](/contact#license)!

If an invalid license key is provided, your application will still continue to work as normal. However, all features provided by notifee
will not work.

Notifee will deem a license key to be invalid under the following scenarios:

- No key is provided in the `notifee.config.json` file (see below).
- [Android] The Application ID does not match the provided ID when generating the key.
- The key is no longer valid (e.g. key has been removed via the dashboard).

## Creating a key

To create a key, you need to have [purchased a license](/purchase) or be assigned to a team with a license.

Once a license has been purchased, navigate to the license page on your [account dashboard](/account/licenses). Here, you
are able to create two types of keys; Primary & Secondary. Choose the key type you wish to use with your application:

| Key Type       |                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Keys   | Used on production release build applications.                                                                              |
| Secondary Keys | Used on release build applications which are not intended for production use, for example, staging or testing applications. |

> When creating a key, ensure that the Application ID (Android) matches that of your application. A license key for iOS is not currently required.

Secondary keys are subject to more frequent checks on their validation. They are designed for non-production applications
only and may unexpectedly be invalidated if used on high traffic applications.

## Using a key

To use a license key with your application, first create a file called `notifee.config.json` in the root of your project.

Copy and add the key to this file, for example:

```json
{
  "android": {
    "license": "XXXX.YYYY.ZZZZ"
  }
}
```

Now rebuild your project, the key will be validated when the application is launched:

```bash
# For Android
npx react-native run-android
```

## Supporting Multiple Environments

If you have multiple license keys, one per product flavor and/or build type, you can structure your `notifee.config.json` like below:

```json
{
  "android": {
    "debug": {
      "license": "debug.license"
    },
    "staging": {
       "license": "staging.license"
    },
     "production": {
       "license": "production.license"
    },
    "full": {
      "debug": {
        "license": "full.debug.license"
      },
      "license": "full.license"
    },
    "license": "android.license"
  }
}
```

If a license key isn't found for a product flavor or build type, it will fallback to the license key in the next level up. For example, a full debug build will fallback to `full.license` if `full.debug.license` wasn't specified. If there was no license specified for `full.license`, it will fallback to `android.license`.

## Debugging

Notifee will output logs during the license verification process to help determine if your config is setup correctly and if your license is valid.

A positive debug message is printed if the verification is successful, or an error message will be printed if unsuccessful.

Example log output when license verification succeeds:
```bash
D/NOTIFEE: (License): Local verification started.
D/NOTIFEE: (License): Local verification succeeded for your application with package name com.app.dev and license key ending in ATnPwEZoN2
```

Example log output when license verification fails:
- `notifee.config.json` missing:
```bash
D/NOTIFEE: (License): Local verification started.
E/NOTIFEE: (License): No license was found. Please ensure you have a created a 'notifee.config.json' file at the root of your project with a valid license key.
```

- License key is invalid:
```bash
D/NOTIFEE: (License): Local verification started.
E/NOTIFEE: (License): Your license key ending in ATnPwEZoWe is invalid. Please ensure you have a valid license key.
```
- License key is for the wrong application:
```bash
D/NOTIFEE: (License): Local verification started.
E/NOTIFEE: (License): Your license key ending in ATnPwEZoWe is not for this application, expected application to be com.notifee.app.dev but found com.notifee.app.staging
```

- License key is for the wrong platform:
```bash
D/NOTIFEE: (License): Local verification started.
E/NOTIFEE: (License): Your license key ending in ATnPwEZoP1 is not for this platform (Android):
```

Helpful Debugging Commands:
 - To turn on Android debug logs during release mode:

`adb shell setprop log.tag.NOTIFEE DEBUG`
- To quickly view Android logs in the terminal:

`adb logcat '*:S' NOTIFEE:D`
