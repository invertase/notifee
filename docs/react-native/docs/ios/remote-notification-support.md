It's possible to display a notification with Notifee features from outside the app using remote notifications (a.k.a push notifications).

By adding a custom key `notifee_options` in the message payload, the notification will be modified by Notifee before it is finally displayed to the end user.

To get started, you will need to implement a [Notification Service Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension) for your iOS app, the following steps will guide you through how to set it up.

## Add the notification service extension

* From Xcode top menu go to: File > New > Target...
* A modal will present a list of possible targets, scroll down or use the filter to select Notification Service Extension. Press Next.
* Add a product name (use `NotifeeNotificationService` to follow along) and click Finish

## Add target to the Podfile

Ensure that your new extension has access to `NotifeeExtensionHelper` by adding it in the Podfile:
* From the Navigator open the Podfile: Pods > Podfile
* Scroll down to the bottom of the file and add

```ruby
$NotifeeExtension = true

target 'NotifeeNotificationService' do
  pod 'RNNotifeeCore', :path => '../node_modules/@notifee/react-native/RNNotifeeCore.podspec'
end

```

* Install or update your pods using pod install from the ios folder

`pod install --repo-update`

## Use the extension helper

At this point everything should still be running normally. This is the final step which is invoking the extension helper.

* From the navigator select your extension
* Open the NotificationService.m file
* At the top of the file import NotifeeExtensionHelper.h right after the NotificationService.h as shown below
```objectivec
#import "NotificationService.h"
+ #import "NotifeeExtensionHelper.h"
```

* then replace everything from line 25 to 28 with the extension helper
```objectivec
- // Modify the notification content here...
- self.bestAttemptContent.title = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ [modified]", self.bestAttemptContent.title];
    
- self.contentHandler(self.bestAttemptContent);
+ [NotifeeExtensionHelper populateNotificationContent:request
                                withContent: self.bestAttemptContent
                                withContentHandler:contentHandler];
```

Before, moving to the next step, run the app and check it builds successfully â€“ make sure you have the correct target selected. 

## Edit the payload
Now everything is setup in your app, you can alter your notification payload to include `notifee_options`:

```json
// FCM
{
    notification: {
      title: 'A notification title!',
      body: 'A notification body',
    },
    apns: {
        payload: {
            aps: {
                'contentAvailable': 1, // Important, to receive `onMessage` event in the foreground when message is incoming
                'mutableContent': 1, // Important, without this the extension won't fire
            },
            notifee_options: {
                image: 'https://placeimg.com/640/480/any', // URL to pointing to a remote image
                ios: {
                    sound: 'media/kick.wav', // A local sound file you have inside your app's bundle
                    categoryId: 'post', // A category that's already been created by your app
                    attachments: [{url: 'https://placeimg.com/640/480/any', thumbnailHidden: true}] // array of attachments of type `IOSNotificationAttachment`
                    ... // any other api properties for NotificationIOS
                },
                ... // any other api properties for Notification, excluding `id`
            },
        },
    },
    ...
};
```

Please note, the `id` of the notification is the `request.identifier` and cannot be changed. For this reason, the `id` property in `notifee_options` should be excluded.

> if both `attachments` and `image` are present, `attachments` will take precedence over `image`
