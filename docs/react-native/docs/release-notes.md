## 2.0.0
- **[Android]: BREAKING CHANGE** - you must add a new maven local repository to your `android/build.gradle` file. (Fixes [#151](https://github.com/notifee/react-native-notifee/issues/151)). See step #2 in [the installation guide](https://notifee.app/react-native/docs/installation)

## 1.11.0
- **[Android]**: Fixes an issue where `getInitialNotification` was sometimes throwing an error leading to a crash if activity was null. (Fixes [#374](https://github.com/notifee/react-native-notifee/issues/374))

## 1.11.0
- **[Android]**: Fixes an issue where the initial notification wasn't being populated for full-screen actions.
- **[iOS]**: Introduces a new method signature for `NotifeeExtensionHelper.populateNotificationContent` where the `request` is passed down as well as the `bestAttemptContent`. View the [Remote Notification Support](https://notifee.app/react-native/docs/ios/remote-notification-support) documentation for more information.
- **[iOS]**: Adds a note in the reference documentation that `getInitialNotification()` for iOS is deprecated in favour of `onForegroundEvent`.


## 1.10.1
- **[Android]**: Fixes an issue on Android to prevent `cancelDisplayedNotifications` cancelling trigger notifications. (Fixes [#349](https://github.com/notifee/react-native-notifee/issues/349))

## 1.10.0
- **[Android/iOS]**: Introduces the following APIs:
  - `getDisplayedNotifications`
  - `getTriggerNotifications`
  - `isChannelBlocked`
  - `isChannelCreated`
  - `cancelAllNotifications(ids)`
  - `cancelDisplayedNotifications(ids)`
  - `cancelTriggerNotifications(ids)`
- **BREAKING**: Fixes an issue when setting a custom sound on a notification channel (Fixes [#341](https://github.com/notifee/react-native-notifee/issues/341)). Sounds now must be specified without the file extension, previously it was optional. **If you were using custom sounds on Android>7 prior to this, you will need to create a *new* notification channel or the reference to your custom sound on the channel will likely not survive app updates. We apologize for the inconvenience**
