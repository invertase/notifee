Triggers can be used to display notifications in-advance when a specific condition is met such as time.

For example, you may wish to notify your user when they have a meeting at work.

# Handling trigger notifications

## Creating a trigger notification

```js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import notifee, { TimestampTrigger, TriggerType } from '@notifee/react-native';

function Screen() {
  async function onCreateTriggerNotification() {
    const date = new Date(Date.now());
    date.setHours(11);
    date.setMinutes(10);

    // Create a time-based trigger
    const trigger: TimestampTrigger = {
      type: TriggerType.TIMESTAMP,
      timestamp: date.getTime(), // fire at 11:10am (10 minutes before meeting)
    };

    // Create a trigger notification
    await notifee.createTriggerNotification(
      {
        title: 'Meeting with Jane',
        body: 'Today at 11:20am',
        android: {
          channelId: 'your-channel-id',
        },
      },
      trigger,
    );
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Create Trigger Notification" onPress={() => onCreateTriggerNotification()} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

> To see a full list of triggers and their properties, view the [Trigger](/react-native/reference/trigger) reference documentation.

The `createTriggerNotification` method is called passing in a `notification` and a `trigger`. You must ensure the channel is created first as well as other attributes your notification may have such as categories.

Go ahead and press the button! A notification will appear in 10 minutes, giving the user a reminder they have a meeting with Jane!

## Updating a trigger notification

Trigger notifications work in the same way as any other notification. They have a random unique ID assigned to them which can be used to update pending trigger notifications. If there is no trigger with that ID, a new one will be created.

Let's update our trigger we created previously to occur weekly.

```js
import notifee, { TimestampTrigger, TriggerType } from '@notifee/react-native';

async function onCreateTriggerNotification() {
    const date = new Date(Date.now());
    date.setHours(11);
    date.setMinutes(10);

    const trigger: TimestampTrigger = {
      type: TriggerType.TIMESTAMP,
      timestamp: date.getTime(),
      repeatFrequency: RepeatFrequency.WEEKLY
    };

  await notifee.createTriggerNotification(
    {
      id: '123',
      title: 'Meeting with Jane',
      body: 'Today at 11:20am',
      android: {
        channelId: 'your-channel-id',
      },
    },
    trigger,
  );
}
```

> To update any notifications that are already displayed, you can update them using [displayNotification](/react-native/docs/displaying-a-notification)

## Retrieving trigger notifications

To retrieve a list of all your trigger notifications you can call [getTriggerNotificationIds](/react-native/reference/gettriggernotificationids) method and a list of ids will be returned.

```js
notifee.getTriggerNotificationIds().then(ids => console.log('All trigger notifications: ', ids));
```

## Cancelling a trigger notification

There may be situations whereby you may want to cancel the trigger notification and stop any future notifications from displaying.

To cancel a trigger notification, the [`cancelNotification`](/react-native/docs/displaying-a-notification#cancelling-a-notification) method can be called with the unique notification ID.

It's also possible to cancel all of your trigger notifications, by calling [cancelTriggerNotifications](/react-native/reference/canceltriggernotifications) or [cancelAllNotifications](/react-native/reference/cancelallnotifications).

# Trigger Types

## Timestamp Trigger

The [`TimestampTrigger`](/react-native/reference/timestamptrigger) allows you to create a trigger that displays a notification at a specific time and date, using the property `timestamp` and an optional `repeatFrequency` property:

```js
import notifee, { TimestampTrigger, TriggerType, TimeUnit } from '@notifee/react-native';

const trigger: TimestampTrigger = {
  type: TriggerType.TIMESTAMP,
  timestamp: Date.now() + 10800, // fire in 3 hours
  repeatFrequency: RepeatFrequency.WEEKLY, // repeat once a week
};
```

On Android, you have the option to create your trigger notification with Android's AlarmManger API:

```js
const trigger: TimestampTrigger = {
  //...
  alarmManager: true
};
```

If you want to allow the notification to display when in low-power idle modes, set `allowWhileIdle`:

```js
const trigger: TimestampTrigger = {
  //...
  alarmManager: {
    allowWhileIdle: true,
  }
};
```

Please note that for iOS, a trigger with a repeat frequency will fire based on the time and not the date. For example, if it is January 1 at 10 AM and you schedule a daily recurring notification for January 2 at 11 AM, it will fire on January 1 at 11 AM and every day thereafter. For more details, please see the discussion [here](https://github.com/notifee/react-native-notifee/issues/241).

## Interval Trigger

The [`IntervalTrigger`](/react-native/reference/intervaltrigger) allows you to create a trigger that repeats at a specific interval. The trigger accepts two properties, an `interval` and an optional `timeUnit`.

This trigger can be used to implement timers.

For example, to set a trigger to repeat every 30 minutes from now:

```js
import notifee, { IntervalTrigger, TriggerType, TimeUnit } from '@notifee/react-native';

const trigger: IntervalTrigger = {
  type: TriggerType.INTERVAL,
  interval: 30
  timeUnit: TimeUnit.MINUTES
};
```
