# Enumeration: AndroidImportance

The interface describing the importance levels of an incoming notification.

The importance level can be set directly onto a notification channel for supported devices (API Level >= 26)
or directly onto the notification for devices which do not support channels.

The importance is used to both change the visual prompt of a received notification
and also how it visually appears on the device.

View the [Android Appearance](/react-native/android/appearance#importance) documentation to learn more.

### HIGH

> **HIGH**: `4`

down the notification shade. This level should only be used for urgent notifications, such as
incoming phone calls, messages etc, which require immediate attention.

### LOW

> **LOW**: `2`

A low importance level applied to a channel/notification.

On Android, the application small icon will show in the device statusbar, however the notification will not alert
the user (no sound or vibration). The notification will show in it's expanded state when the
notification shade is pulled down.

On iOS, the notification will not display to the user or alert them. It will still be visible on the devices
notification center.

### MIN

> **MIN**: `1`

The minimum importance level applied to a channel/notification.

The application small icon will not show up in the statusbar, or alert the user. The notification
will be in a collapsed state in the notification shade and placed at the bottom of the list.

This level should be used when the notification requires no immediate attention. An example of this
importance level is the Google app providing weather updates and only being visible when the
user pulls the notification shade down,
