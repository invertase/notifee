# Interface: NotificationPressAction

The interface used to describe a press action for a notification.

There are various ways a user can interact with a notification, the most common being pressing
the notification, pressing an action or providing text input. This interface defines what happens
when a user performs such interaction.

On Android; when provided to a notification action, the action will only open you application if
a `launchActivity` and/or a `mainComponent` is provided.

## Properties

### id

> **id**: `string`

The unique ID for the action.

The `id` property is used to differentiate between user press actions. When listening to notification
events, the ID can be read from the `event.detail.pressAction` object.
