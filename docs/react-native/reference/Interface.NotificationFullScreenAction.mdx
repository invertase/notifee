[@notifee/react-native](react-native/reference/index) / NotificationFullScreenAction

# Interface: NotificationFullScreenAction

The interface used to describe a full-screen action for a notification.

By setting a `fullScreenAction`, when the notification is displayed, it will launch a full-screen intent.

On Android; when provided to a notification action, the action will only open you application if
a `launchActivity` and/or a `mainComponent` is provided.

Requires the following permission to be added to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT" />
```

Please see the [FullScreen Action](/react-native/android/behaviour#full-screen) document to learn more.

## Properties

### id

> **id**: `string`

The unique ID for the action.

The `id` property is used to differentiate between full-screen actions. When listening to notification
events, the ID can be read from the `event.detail.notification.android.fullScreenAction` object.
