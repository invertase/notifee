# Interface: NotificationAndroid

The interface for Android specific options which are applied to a notification.

To learn more about Android notifications, view the [Android](/react-native/android/introduction)
documentation for full examples and usage.

## Platform

android

## Properties

### actions?

> `optional` **actions**: [`AndroidAction`](react-native/reference/Interface.AndroidAction)\[]

An array of [AndroidAction](/react-native/reference/androidaction) interfaces.

Adds quick actions to a notification. Quick Actions enable users to interact with your application
directly from the notification body, providing an overall greater user experience.

View the [Quick Actions](/react-native/android/interaction#quick-actions) documentation for more information.

#### Defined in

[packages/react-native/src/types/NotificationAndroid.ts:24](https://github.com/invertase/notifee/blob/main/packages/react-native/src/types/NotificationAndroid.ts#L24)

***

### asForegroundService?

> `optional` **asForegroundService**: `boolean`

When set to `true` this notification will be shown as a foreground service.

The application can only display one foreground service notification at once. If a
foreground service notification is already running and a new notification with this flag set to
`true` is provided, the service will stop the existing service and start a new one.

Ensure a foreground service runner function has been provided to `registerForegroundService`.
Without one, the notification will not be displayed.

View the [Foreground Service](/react-native/android/foreground-service) documentation for more information.

Defaults to `false`.

#### Defined in

[packages/react-native/src/types/NotificationAndroid.ts:40](https://github.com/invertase/notifee/blob/main/packages/react-native/src/types/NotificationAndroid.ts#L40)

***

### autoCancel?

> `optional` **autoCancel**: `boolean`

Setting this flag will make it so the notification is automatically canceled when the user
presses it in the panel.

By default when the user taps a notification it is automatically removed from the notification
panel. Setting this to `false` will keep the notification in the panel.

If `false`, the notification will persist in the notification panel after being pressed. It will
remain there until the user removes it (e.g. swipes away) or is cancelled via
[`cancelNotification`](/react-native/reference/cancelNotification).

Defaults to `true`.

if alerts for this notification's group should be handled by a different notification. This is

### importance?

> `optional` **importance**: [`AndroidImportance`](react-native/reference/Enumeration.AndroidImportance)

without channel support, set this property to directly assign an importance level to the incoming
notification.
