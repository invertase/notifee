The Android API allows for creating rich, styled and highly interactive notifications. Notifications are an important
concept on Android, and frequently receive new updates with each new API version.

Notifee has been designed to integrate with the latest API features, and also provide backwards compatibility for
older Android devices (Android 4.4W (API 20)).
