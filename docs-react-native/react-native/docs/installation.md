## 1. Install via npm

Install Notifee to the root of your React Native project with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save @notifee/react-native

# Using Yarn
yarn add @notifee/react-native
```


## 2. Autolinking with React Native
Users on React Native 0.60+ automatically have access to "[autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md)",
requiring no further manual installation steps. To automatically link the package, rebuild your project:

```bash
# For iOS
cd ios/ && pod install --repo-update
npx react-native run-ios

# For Android
npx react-native run-android
```

## Miscellaneous

### Expo Support
Notifee has a built-in expo plugin you can install into an Expo managed project.

First, add Notifee to your project:
`expo install @notifee/react-native`

Then, add `@notifee/react-native` to the list of plugins in your app's Expo config (`app.json` or `app.config.js`):
```json
{
  "name": "my app",
  "plugins": [
    "@notifee/react-native"
  ]
}
```

Finally, ensure you run `expo prebuild` and rebuild your app as described in the ["Adding custom native code"](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/) guide.

Please note that Notifee needs Java JDK 11+ to build on Android. If you are building the app with EAS, you need to change the image used for the build. You will have to use `image` as `ubuntu-18.04-jdk-11-ndk-r19c` or another image that has jdk 11 as in the following configuration. ([EAS Build Server Configuration](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/infrastructure/#image--ubuntu-1804-jdk-8-ndk-r19c--alias--default))

eas.json:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "dev": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "image": "ubuntu-18.04-jdk-11-ndk-r19c"
      }
    }
}
```
