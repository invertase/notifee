  - This allows quick actions from remote notifications to be supported without the need of a NSE [[Learn More]](https://notifee.app/react-native/docs/ios/remote-notification-support)

  **`onNotificationOpenedApp` and `getInitialNotification` from `RNFB Messaging` will no longer trigger as notifee will handle the event. Should not require any code changes to these `RNFB` event handlers, as events on Android will continue to work as normal**

## 6.0.0

- **[Android] BREAKING CHANGE**: Added support for requesting permission on Android 13 via `requestPermission`,  the minimum compileSdkVersion required has increased to 33. And, to support this feature, the targetSdkVersion must also be increased to 33.

These new options should be used as a replacement for the `alert` option which is now deprecated in notifee; notifee will fallback to using Apple's `UNNotificationPresentationOptionAlert` option for iOS 13 when either `banner` or `list` is set to true. There are no breaking changes, but we encourage you to update your project as soon as you can if you set custom `IOSForegroundPresentationOptions`. To learn more, view the [Foreground Notifications](/react-native/docs/ios/appearance#foreground-notifications) documentation (Enhancement [#382](https://github.com/invertase/notifee/issues/382)).

## 5.0.3

- **[Android]**: Fixes an issue when canceling trigger notifications created via AlarmManager to prevent "Maximum limit of concurrent alarms 500 reached for uid" error being thrown (Fixes [#349](https://github.com/invertase/notifee/issues/349)).
