> It is recommended to only use a notification service extension if you require an image or need to modify the contents of the notification before display.

It is possible to display a notification with Notifee features from outside the app using remote notifications (a.k.a push notifications) by using the combination of a`notifee_options` section in your remote notification message (see below for example) and the Notifee notification service extension helper.

Adding a custom key `notifee_options` in the remote notification message (as shown below) enables Notifee to modify the notification before it is finally displayed to the end user. If your use case requires it, you may also use custom native code as shown below to change the notification before display.

> ‚≠êÔ∏è In order to bring the iOS experience - where data-only messages are rarely delivered - closer to the Android one where data-only messages have high delivery rates, you may still send **data-only** notifications for Android while using messages with a **notification** payload for iOS [by configuring the right payload.](#configure-the-payload)

To get started, you will need to implement a [Notification Service Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension) for your iOS app, the following steps will guide you through how to set it up.

### Expo

You can jump straight to [configuring the payload](#configure-the-payload) if you use Expo with one of the community plugins:
- https://github.com/LunatiqueCoder/expo-notifee-plugin
- https://github.com/evennit/notifee-expo-plugin

## Add the notification service extension

* From Xcode top menu go to: File > New > Target...
* A modal will present a list of possible targets, scroll down or use the filter to select Notification Service Extension. Press Next.
* Add a product name (use `NotifeeNotificationService` to follow along) and click Finish
* You may use Swift or Objective-C where it says 'language' but be sure to follow the correct section below depending on your implementation language selection
* Make sure that the **deployment target** of your newly added extension (e.g. `NotifeeNotificationService`) matches the **deployment target** of your app. You can check it by selecting you app's target -> `Build Settings` -> `Deployment`

## Add target to the Podfile

Ensure that your new extension has access to `NotifeeExtensionHelper` by adding it in the Podfile:
* From the Navigator open the Podfile: Pods > Podfile
* Scroll down to the bottom of the file and add

```ruby
$NotifeeExtension = true

target 'NotifeeNotificationService' do
  pod 'RNNotifeeCore', :path => '../node_modules/@notifee/react-native/RNNotifeeCore.podspec'
end

```
* Assuming you are using `react-native-firebase`, you must also add `use_frameworks!` inside the target above as [you did when you followed their docs](https://rnfirebase.io/#altering-cocoapods-to-use-frameworks).
* Install or update your pods using pod install from the ios folder

`pod install --repo-update`

<!-- <Vimeo id="remote-notification-support-2" caption="Step 2 - Update Your Pods" /> -->

## Use the extension helper

At this point everything should still be running normally. This is the final step which is invoking the extension helper.

* From the navigator select your extension
* Open the NotificationService.m file
* At the top of the file import NotifeeExtensionHelper.h right after the NotificationService.h as shown below
```objectivec
#import "NotificationService.h"
+ #import "NotifeeExtensionHelper.h"
```

* then replace everything from line 25 to 28 with the extension helper
```objectivec
- // Modify the notification content here...
- self.bestAttemptContent.title = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ [modified]", self.bestAttemptContent.title];

- self.contentHandler(self.bestAttemptContent);
+ [NotifeeExtensionHelper populateNotificationContent:request
                                withContent: self.bestAttemptContent
                                withContentHandler:contentHandler];
```
<!-- <Vimeo id="remote-notification-support-3" caption="Step 3 - Edit NotificationService.m" /> -->

## Mutate the content with Notifee:
> üîó [Apple Docs: Modifying content in newly delivered notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/modifying-content-in-newly-delivered-notifications#Implement-your-extensions-handler-methods)

#### Objective-C:

In your `NotifeeNotificationService.m` file you should have method `didReceiveNotificationRequest` where we are calling `NotifeeExtensionHelper`. Now you can modify
`bestAttemptContent` before you send it to `NotifeeExtensionHelper`:

```objectivec
#import "NotificationService.h"
#import "NotifeeExtensionHelper.h"

- (void)didReceiveNotificationRequest:(UNNotificationRequest *)request withContentHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationContent * _Nonnull))contentHandler {
    self.contentHandler = contentHandler;
    self.bestAttemptContent = [request.content mutableCopy];

     // You can also modify the payload as you please here.
     // You have around 30 seconds

     // Notifee will mutate the notification according to notifee_options
    [NotifeeExtensionHelper populateNotificationContent:request
                                withContent: self.bestAttemptContent
                                withContentHandler:contentHandler];
}
```

#### Swift:

In your `NotifeeNotificationService.swift` file, use the `didReceive(_:withContentHandler:)` method to enable the `NotifeeExtensionHelper`.

```swift
import UIKit
import RNNotifeeCore

typealias ContentHandler = (UNNotificationContent) -> Void

override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest,
                         withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
    self.contentHandler = contentHandler
    self.bestAttempt = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)

    // Here you can also modify the content of the notification as you please here.
    // You have around 30 seconds


    // Notifee will mutate the notification according to notifee_options
    NotifeeExtensionHelper.populateNotificationContent(request,
                            with: self.bestAttempt!,
                            withContentHandler: contentHandler)
}
```

<br>

Before moving to the next step, run the app and check it builds successfully ‚Äì make sure you have the correct target selected.

## Configure the payload
> Make sure that you will set `mutable-content: 1` (mutableContent if you are using firebase admin sdk) when sending notification otherwise Notification Service Extension will NOT be triggered

### Here's an example of a payload sent from the backend with Firebase Admin Node.js SDK

```ts

import type {Notification} from '@notifee/react-native/src/types/Notification';
import {AndroidImportance} from '@notifee/react-native/src/types/NotificationAndroid';
import {MulticastMessage} from 'firebase-admin/lib/messaging/messaging-api';
import admin from '../src/firebase-admin';

/**
 * @link https://notifee.app/react-native/reference/notification
 */
const notifeeOptions: Notification = {
  title: 'Title',
  subtitle: 'Subtitle',
  body: 'Main body content of the notification',
  image: 'https://placeimg.com/640/480/any', // URL to pointing to a remote image
  android: {
    channelId: 'default',
    importance: AndroidImportance.HIGH,
    lightUpScreen: true,
    pressAction: {
      id: 'default',
    },
    sound: 'default',
  },
  ios: {
    sound: 'media/kick.wav', // A local sound file you have inside your app's bundle
    categoryId: 'post', // Must be a category that has already been created by your app
    attachments: [{url: 'https://placeimg.com/640/480/any', thumbnailHidden: true}] // array of attachments of type `IOSNotificationAttachment`
    // üöß Adding `foregroundPresentationOptions` controls how to
    // üëá behave when app is UP AND RUNNING, not terminated, AND not in background!
    foregroundPresentationOptions: {
      badge: true,
      banner: true,
      list: true,
      sound: true,
    },
  },
};


/**
 * @description Firebase Message
 * @link https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/firebase-admin.messaging.basemessage.md#basemessage_interface
 */
const message: MulticastMessage = {
  // ‚úÖ We can continue using local/data-only notification for Android
  // üëç while triggering iOS remote notifications from `apns`
  data: {notifee_options: JSON.stringify(notifeeOptions)},
  tokens: [],
  android: {
    priority: 'high', // Needed to achieve reliable delivery for data-only notifications on Android
  },
  apns: {
    payload: {
      notifee_options: notifeeOptions,
      aps: {
        // Payloads coming from Admin SDK should specify params in camelCase.
        // Payloads from REST API should specify in kebab-case
        // see their respective reference documentation
        alert: {
          // üöß This is needed to achieve reliable delivery only for iOS
          // üëç but Android will continue using data-only notifications
          title: 'ANY_DUMMY_STRING', // Or notifeeOptions.title :)
        },
        'mutableContent': 1, // Important, without this the extension won't fire
      },
    },
  },
};

try {
  admin.messaging().sendEachForMulticast(message)
  res.status(200).end();
} catch (e) {
  res.status(400).end();
}
```

Please note, the `id` of the notification is the `request.identifier` and cannot be changed. For this reason, the `id` property in `notifee_options` should be excluded.

> If both `attachments` and `image` are present, `attachments` will take precedence over `image`

### Handling Events

Currently, notifee supports the following events for remote notifications:
- `PRESSED`
- `ACTION_PRESSED`
- `DISMISSED`

> On iOS, only notifications with a `categoryId` will receive a `DISMISSED` event.

To know identify when an interaction is from a remote notification, we can check if `notification.remote` is populated:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import notifee, { EventType } from '@notifee/react-native';
function App() {
  // Subscribe to events
  useEffect(() => {
    return notifee.onForegroundEvent(({ type, detail }) => {
      console.log('Remote notification info: ', detail.notification?.remote)
      switch (type) {
        case EventType.DISMISSED:
          console.log('User dismissed notification', detail.notification);
          break;
        case EventType.PRESS:
          console.log('User pressed notification', detail.notification);
          break;
      }
    });
  }, []);
}
```
